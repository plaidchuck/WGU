# Chapter 4 Exercises  

-	Logging and monitoring are reactive auditing procedures, they are done after some incident has happened.  Assessments work on the current state of the system.  ***Qualys*** is a vulnerability assessment tool.  

1.	The benefits of logging can be for compliance/regulartory issues, they hold people accountable, they can deter people from not compying or performing illegal/harmful actions.  

2.	Authorization involves implementing the access to resources for those who have established and verified their identity.  Accountability makes sure the users actions are recorded to verify who did what and at what time and that they complied with all aspects of the organizations mission.  Helps with nonrepudiation and for following a timeline of events for an incident.  

3.	It is the case when you have the proper evidence to disprove anyone lying about whatever action they may have taken.  

4.	You would want to audit passwords, purchases on a credit card, software licenses, internet usage within an organization, attributes of accessing data like time and place.  

5.	Accountability is important as it can be used to verify who may have accessed or changed data, and also this comes into place if the data is sensitive where it is under regulartory control where it may be a criminal matter of who accessed data and what they did with it.  

6.	Auditing software is important both for patches and vulnerabilites as well as making sure software licenses are up to date. There are auditing firms who act on behalf of software companies to confirm this.  

7.	Again, data breaches and issues with sensitive data can have legal complications for a company which makes auditing important.  

8.	Vulnerability assessments assess  weaknesses that are open in an organization's environment.  Penetration Testing is an active testing in an attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities to see how any risk mitigation procedures actually perform under pressure.  

9.	Chain of custody is a consideration for auditing purposes, meaning evidence may be deemed inadmissable if the chain of custody was not properly documented and established.  

10.	Both vulnerability and penetration testing is important to find weaknesses and to to also test the established defenses.  Penetration testing must be done carefully as the privacy of data must be considered especially if the testing is done on a production environment.
