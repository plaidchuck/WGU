# Chapter 2 Exercises  

1.	Verification/identification is the first step in presenting who is to be authenticated, e.g. an email, username, name.  IDs like a license or passport can be verified but this is still not sufficient to complete authentication. Authentication is the confirmation of the identity by some authentication factor: something you are/know/have/do/located  

2.	Ways to measure performance of biometric checks:  False Acceptance/False Rejection Rates.  Equal Error Rate is the goal as it is a middle ground and accuracy check between extreme ends of false rejection or false acceptance.  

3.	Mutual authentication between client and server can prevent man in the middle attacks by using digital certificates.  

4.	A key(physical or logical) is something you have.  

5.	Permanence is a biometric characteristic that describes how some attribute resists change over time.  

6.	An identity card, a palm scan, and a password is a multifactor example of something you have, are, and know.  

7.	A simply longer lower case only password would not significantly increase the complexity of the password.  As anything brute force could break it or the password could just as easily be remembered or written down.  

8.	An identity card could be falsified, it could not accurately reflect who someone looks like at this time of their life, also attributes on the card could have changed like name.  Other legitimate forms of id could be used to generate new IDs that reinforce false identity.  

9.	For a shared workstation MFA:  A hardware token (have), password(know), fingerprint scanner(are), captcha or keystroke analysis(do)  
10.	For injured/disabled patients: Use DOB(know), patient ID band(have), avoid: fingerprint(not everyone may have the digit), attributes like eye color/weight/tattoo/scar may be viable(are),
