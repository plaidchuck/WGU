Systems Development Life cycle

-	**Analysis**
	-	Associated with Use Case behavioral diagram. Phase to consult with users/stakeholders to determine how they will interact with program and the program's goals.

- **Design**
	-	Associated with Class structural diagram that is a structural diagram that defines static variables and attributes of the program and its classes. Defines specifics on how to build program.

-	**Implementation**
	-	Involves writing the program. Associated with behavioral activity diagrams and flowcharts which show the behavior of the program.

-	**Testing**
	-	Checks that the program meets the specified goals. Associated with behavorial sequence diagram which shows interaction between software components and order of events.

	Diagrams are not confined to a single cycle. E.g. the Testing cycle can using all of the diagrams to test how all components of program interact with eachother and meet the goals and functionalties of stakeholders and implementers.

	The Analysis cycle can use Use Case and Sequence Diagrams to visualize how users will interact with the program and how the program will operate with software components

	The Design cycle can use the class diagram and sequence diagram to visualize the structure of classes and objects within the program and how they will operate.
