# Section 1 - Networking Concepts

A network is a collection of devices and their infrastructure in order to share data and resources.

## Network Devices

**Hub** - "Dumb" device that sends traffic to all devices on network on Physical OSI layer. Old, outdated. Still used example: USB hub.

**Switch** - "Smart" device that uses MAC addresses to forward traffic directly to and from the sender/receiver respectively. Operates on Data Link layer of OSI model. There are also Layer 3/Multi-layer Switches that can handle routing duties.

**Router** - A point of connection between two or more networks that forwards data packets. Operates on Network layer of OSI.

**Access Point** - Normally used to connect a wireless device to a wired LAN. Strictly acts a bridge between different physical connections in a network. At Data Link layer of OSI.
